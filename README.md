Shortcut while API not working
=========================================================
A = You Win Screen
B = You Lose Screen

When in Pause Menu, if you click on the resume button,
the countdown timer starts.
When it reaches 0 it should call the query to the API
to ask for the word, but as the API doesn't work,
you can't recieve the answer meaning it doesn't go 
to the Game Over screen.
